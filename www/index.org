* Introduction

The =solaR= package allows for reproducible research both for
photovoltaics (PV) systems performance and solar radiation. It
includes a set of classes, methods and functions to calculate the
sun geometry and the solar radiation incident on a photovoltaic
generator and to simulate the performance of several applications
of the photovoltaic energy. This package performs the whole
calculation procedure from both daily and intradaily global
horizontal irradiation to the final productivity of grid-connected
PV systems and water pumping PV systems.

It is designed using a set of S4 classes whose core is a group of
slots with multivariate time series. The classes share a variety
of methods to access the information and several visualization
methods. In addition, the package provides a tool for the visual
statistical analysis of the performance of a large PV plant
composed of several systems.

Although =solaR= is primarily designed for time series associated to
a location defined by its latitude/longitude values and the
temperature and irradiation conditions, it can be easily combined
with spatial packages for space-time analysis.  

* Documentation

The best place to learn how to use the package is the companion
paper published by the Journal of Statistical Software: [[http://www.jstatsoft.org/v50/i09/]]

[[http://procomun.wordpress.com/documentos/libroesf/][This book]] (in Spanish) contains detailed information about solar
radiation and photovoltaic systems. In [[http://procomun.wordpress.com/documentos/articulos/][my articles]] I
frequently use =solaR=. Besides, I publish news and examples
about =solaR= at [[http://procomun.wordpress.com/][this blog]].
