\title{Nomogram of a photovoltaic pumping system
}
\description{
  This function simulate the performance of a water pump fed by a frequency converter with several PV generators of different size during a day. The result is plotted as a nomogram which relates the nominal power of the PV generator, the total water flow and the total manometric head.
